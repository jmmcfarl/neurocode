NIM toolbox for Matlab==================Toolbox for estimating nonlinear input models (LNLN cascade)Authors: James M. McFarland, Yuwei Cui, and Daniel A. ButtsHomepage: http://www.clfs.umd.edu/biology/ntlab/NIM/Reference: Paper under revisionINSTALLATION AND REQUIREMENTS:Add the NIM directory to your Matlab path.The NIM toolbox requires the Matlab optimization toolbox. Use of L1 regularization requires installation of the "L1General" package created by Mark Schmidt (available at: http://www.di.ens.fr/~mschmidt/)We also recommend installing Mark Schmidt's unconstrained and constrained nonlinear optimization functions "minFunc" and "minConf_TMP". While not necessary for using the NIM toolbox, the function 'minFunc' in particular runs significantly faster than Matlab's 'fminunc' in most cases.USE:See one of the example applications available from the website.Distributed under the BSD license (see LICENSE.txt)Please report any bugs to James McFarland at jmmcfarl@umd.edu
