Introduction
============

This directory contains a port of the neuralynx file readers for CSC, EV, VT, SE and TT files. 
This linux/mac port is based on the original windows/MFC version, developed and provided by Neuralynx.

There are two versions: One for 32 Bit and one for 64 Bit. Scripts are provided for Linux and Mac OS X, 
adaptation to other operating systems (with gcc) should, however, be fairly easily.

This archive also contains compiled versions for Linux 32/64 Bit as well as Mac OS X 32/64 Bit. If these files work
for you you can use them. However, if they dont (due to different libraries, Matlab versions etc) you need to recompile
them yourself. In Linux,this only requires standard compilers. Same for Mac OS X (but "Xcode" needs to be installed,by default
Mac OS X does not install the compiler). Xcode can be downloaded from apple.com for free.


Compilation
===========

Adjust compile.sh so that it uses your Matlab and compiles for the correct platform.
Then execute compile.sh , which will create the mex files.

Parameters (both in compile.sh)
1) Set the variable PLATFORM to one of the following: 32PC, 64PC, 32MAC, 64MAC
2) the path of matlab  
These variables need to be adjusted manually before

Note: The version of Matlab installed determines whether you need the 32/64 version and not the operating system. 
If you're not sure whether your matlab is 32 or 64 bits, type 'computer' on the matlab prompt.
This will output a string such as GLNX86 (32-bit linux), GLNXA64 (64-bit linux) or MACI64 (64-bit mac).

Testing
=======

The 32-bit version was tested on:
Ubuntu Linux, g++ 4.2.3, Matlab 7.6 (and higher)

The 64-bit linux version was tested on:
Redhat Linux EL5, g++ 4.1.2 and Matlab 2010

The 32-bit Mac OS X version was tested on:
Mac OS X 10.5, g++ 4.0.1 and Matlab 2009a

The 64-bit Mac OS X version was tested on:
Mac OS X 10.5, g++ 4.0.1 and Matlab 2010b

The pre-compiled binaries provided in the archive are these versions.

Setup and demo files
====================

compile.sh generates the files Nlx2MatCSC_v3.mexglx, Nlx2MatEV_v3.mexglx, Nlx2MatVT_v3.mexglx and Nlx2MatSpikes_v3.mexglx
(mexglx is 32-bit PC, as an example). Put these two files in a directory that is in the matlab search path 
(or add the new path to the matlab search path). The functions have the same syntax and functionality as the windows
versions. Help is available from within matlab with 'help Nlx2MatCSC_v3' or 'help Nlx2MatEV_v3'.

The file ending will be mexa64 for 64-bit, mexmaci for 32-bit mac and mexmaci64 for 64-bit mac (instead of mexglx as stated above).

Three example matlab files are included:
getRawCSCData.m  : reads raw signal from a CSC file
getRawCSCTimestamps.m : reads timestamps from a CSC file
getRawTTLs.m: reads TTLS from an event file
getRawSE.m: reads from spike files (*.se,*.tt)

example of reading an event file:
events = getRawTTLs('Events.Nev');

reading csc data:
[timestamps,dataSamples] = getRawCSCData( 'a8.ncs', 198, 200 );


!! Note: If the mex function gives errors such as "Corrupt file - incomplete record encountered" it means you compiled
the wrong version or used the wrong compatibility.h (wrong architecture, as when using the 32bit version for 64). 
DO NOT ignore this warning - the data returnend is corrupt!
